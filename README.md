I am an entry-level cybersecurity learner with a strong interest in protecting systems, data, and people from digital threats. My background in IT and recent training in cybersecurity have given me a basic understanding of security tools, threat detection, and safe computing practices. I enjoy solving problems, learning new techniques, and exploring how attackers think, so I can defend better. I am now building my skills and experience to begin my professional journey in cybersecurity.

## Objective
To begin my career in cybersecurity in a role where I can learn, grow, and apply my foundational knowledge of security concepts, system protection, and incident handling. I want to work with a team that values learning and supports skill development. My goal is to become a capable cybersecurity professional who can analyze threats, support security operations, and contribute to a safer digital environment.

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Skills
These are the technical and practical skills I have gained so far in my early cybersecurity learning. I am actively improving these abilities while exploring new concepts and tools to strengthen my understanding.
